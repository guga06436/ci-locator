## About

Under the current situation of pandemic and social isolation, the live activities of the Federal Universities have been suspended and therefore the students of Campus V enrolled after the 2019.2 period have not been able, until now, to visit their place of study. With that in mind, we decided, in order to avoid complications for students when the face-to-face period returns, build a code in Prolog capable of helping the student to locate and move around both inside and outside the institution.
